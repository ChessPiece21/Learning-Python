# Self-Learning Python
This is the repository for all of my self-learning, just a way to document my journey. 
<br>
For now, I'm just learning Python from Melanie Walsh's *[Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)*.
<br>
## To do/check out:
- [Network Analysis and Visualization](http://www.josephferrare.com/bis-447) (BIS 447) from [Joe Ferrare](https://www.uwb.edu/ias/faculty-and-staff/joseph-ferrare) (UW Bothell), *once I finish Mel's textbook, as this is an advanced Python course*.
- UW Libraries Data Services workshops on Python and R.
