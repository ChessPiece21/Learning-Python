## Lesson 8: Functions
# A function is way of bundling up code to perform specific tasks. It's kind of like making a little Python wind-up toy that runs on command.
# We've encountered built-in functions in Python many times already, including print(), len(), and type().

## Defining functions.
# To make your own function, you use the keyword def, short for define, followed by your desired name for the function, parentheses (()) and a colon (:).
# Finally, you complete the function with a return statement.
# To try this out, create a function called sing(), where the content is that it prints the opening line to a song you like.
def sing():
  print(f"ðŸŽµSOME-body once told me...ðŸŽµ")
  
## Calling Functions:
# To call a function you simply type the name of the function in parentheses.
sing()
